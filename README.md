I think this take-home assignment showcases my skills effectively due to the constraints and circumstances.
This was for a senior software engineer position I applied to about two years ago. I applied despite only having three years of experience (I considered myself more mid level).
The assignment was expected to be completed in four hours. I didn't have time to perfect my code, I just needed to do my best to finish the assignment and hopefully leave time for comments and some refactoring.
I'm particularly proud of this assignment because not only did I complete it, but I also later found out they didn't adjust the difficulty of the take-home for me and they weren't expecting me to finish.
Since then I've learned a lot and would say I'm a much better developer.
