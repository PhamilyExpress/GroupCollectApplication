The README.pdf is the file provided by the company and the .ex file is my solution.

I think this takehome assignment is a good showcase of my skills because of the constraints and circumstances.
This was a senior software engineer position I applied to about two years ago. At the time, I only had three years of experience but I applied anyways.
You're expected to use no more than four hours to complete the assignment.
I'm especially proud of this assignment because not only did I complete the assignment with comments and some refactoring, I was told after the fact that they didn't adjust the difficulty of the takehome for me and they weren't expecting me to finish.
That was two years ago and I've only gotten better since then.
